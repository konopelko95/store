to start the project:
    go run main.go


    about index.html:
    This code defines a basic HTML form with three fields: currency, amount, and cryptocurrency. 
    The form also includes a submit button and a container div for displaying the result of the buy operation.

Note that we have included minimum amount validation for the amount field using the min attribute.

Add some basic styling to your HTML file using CSS. You can add a style element to the head section of your HTML file:
This CSS code adds some basic styling to the HTML elements. 
For example, we define a font family and set some margins and padding for the body, 
we set the text alignment for the h1 element, and we add some styles for the form fields and the submit button.

Save the file and open it in a web browser to test it. 
You should see a simple form with fields for selecting the currency, amount, and cryptocurrency, as well as a button for submitting the form.

This is a simple example of a frontend that you can use to interact with the backend API that we implemented in the previous steps. 
When the user submits the form, you can use AJAX to send the form data to the backend, process the request, and display the result on the page.

In the next step, we will connect the frontend to the backend and 
implement the necessary functionality to process the form data and buy the selected cryptocurrency.
